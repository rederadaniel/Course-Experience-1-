  <h1>Course Experience</h1>
  
  <p>As a senior high school student, I'm about to have my first experience in the computer lab for our ICT 11 class. I don't know all about the program, and when I start, I'm shocked at how to do and write my first code. But I'm eager to learn and understand these new concepts.</p>
  
  <p>In our ICT 11 class, we'll start by learning about the fundamental concepts of how computers work and how they execute code. Our teacher will guide us through simple programming ideas, like data types and basic operations, using visual aids and hands-on activities. I'm sure it will be a bit overwhelming at first, but I'm eager to learn and understand these new concepts.</p>
  

  
  <p>One unique aspect of learning ICT 11 without a computer is the emphasis on problem-solving and logical thinking. Our teacher will present us with sample problems, and we'll work together with our classmates to come up with solutions, using pen and paper or other physical materials. I'm excited to collaborate with my peers and develop these important problem-solving skills.</p>
  
  <div class="unique-feature">
    <p>The collaborative nature of the ICT 11 classroom is a special feature of this course. We'll have the opportunity to share ideas, learn from our peers, and develop a strong support network as we navigate the world of computer programming. I'm looking forward to building these connections and learning from my classmates.</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>While I may not be able to write and execute code right away, the skills we develop in ICT 11 will lay a solid foundation for our future programming endeavors. Let's stay engaged, collaborate with our classmates, and embrace the hands-on learning experience â€“ we'll be well on our way to becoming confident programmers.</p>
